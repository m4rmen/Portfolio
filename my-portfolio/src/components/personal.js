                    I am 23 years old, half Costa Rican and half Canadian/Québécois, which gives me a unique perspective on life and work. I’m trilingual (English, French, Spanish) and love connecting with people from different cultures.

                    Outside of tech, I’m passionate about music producing (FL Studio), gaming, and football (soccer). I also love experimenting with cybersecurity oriented gadgets and tools.

                    I consider myself team-oriented, adaptable, and a quick learner. I am however also autonomous and "débrouillard".
